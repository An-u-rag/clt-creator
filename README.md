Abstract:

Today, school students are first introduced to geometry and advanced mathematical concepts by plotting a graph and they struggle with 3D concepts since current technologies can either be too difficult to grasp or too simple with only drag-drop functionalities with no focus on the underlying key concepts. This article presents a 3D graphics library and an interactive, educational system for visualization of a 3D environment where planks of Cross Laminated Timber can be manipulated by geometric and mathematical functions to produce a 3D building-like structure. Through this, there is a focus on functions, 3D geometry and other underlying mathematics, as these mathematical concepts are closely linked with the world of computing, specifically in the fields of computer graphics, which will increase studentsâ€™ confidence as they will be programming in Elm whilst also spreading the idea of sustainable and clean construction.
